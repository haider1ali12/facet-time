# Facet-Time
Facet-Time is an analytical tool that supports users analyzing temporal data with a specific focus on supporting exploratory search in the data. It has been designed to support searchersâ€™ knowledge discovery, temporal analysis, and comparison of subsets of the data. This tool encourages interactive information-seeking behaviour.

When users search for information or perform visual analysis, they utilize their general background knowledge to seek the information. There is a chance that they might not be able to explore all aspects of data because of their ill-defined needs. This research focuses on helping users explore diverse aspects of timeseries data utilizing information-seeking strategies. It uses an exploratory search technique to provide support for data analysis.

Facet-Time utilizes faceted navigation adapted to a timeline. Faceted navigation enables users to explore multiple perspectives of datasets. As users make selections in facets to define queries, the data get filtered according to those selections, allowing the users to create queries interactively for further analysis of data on the timeline.
